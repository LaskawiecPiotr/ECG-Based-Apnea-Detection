# Replication of Apnea Detection Methods from arXiv:2302.05179v1

## Overview
This repository replicates the methods described in the paper "Title of Paper" (arXiv:2302.05179v1) for experimental and educational purposes.
We follow the methodology outlined by the authors and use the Apnea-ECG Dataset, which was also employed in the original study.

We replicate the methods described in the paper **["AIOSA: An approach to the automatic identification of obstructive sleep apnea events based on deep learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05179)** for experimental and educational purposes.

As part of this project, we also launched a web-based application that allows users to upload their own ECG signals and receive sleep apnea detection predictions using the models we implemented.

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

To replicate and validate the results reported in the paper.
To provide an educational resource for those interested in apnea detection and ECG-based classification.
To create a practical application for real-time ECG analysis.

## Dataset

We use the **[Apnea-ECG dataset](https://www.physionet.org/content/apnea-ecg/)**, which contains electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings for sleep apnea detection. For details on how to access and use this dataset, please refer to the official dataset documentation.


## Implementation

The implementation follows the steps outlined in the paper, including:

Data Preprocessing: Preparing the ECG signals for training and testing.
Feature Extraction: Extracting features as described by the authors.
Modeling and Classification: Building and training the models to detect sleep apnea events.

## Tools and Libraries


## Web Application

The web application allows users to upload their ECG recordings and obtain predictions in real time.
Visit the website here: **[ECG Based Apnea Detection](https://ecg-based-apnea-detection.streamlit.app/)**
The uploaded data is processed using the same methodology described in the paper, and the results are displayed in an easy-to-understand format.

## Results

We aim to reproduce the key results from the paper and compare them with the published outcomes. Detailed analysis and performance evaluation will be documented.

## Acknowledgments

We acknowledge the authors of the original paper for their contribution to the field and PhysioNet for providing the Apnea-ECG dataset.
