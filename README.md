# Apnea Detection Web Application

## Overview


## Purpose


To create a practical application for real-time ECG analysis.

## Dataset

We use the **[Apnea-ECG dataset](https://www.physionet.org/content/apnea-ecg/)**, which contains electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings for sleep apnea detection. For details on how to access and use this dataset, please refer to the official dataset documentation.


## Implementation

The implementation follows the steps outlined in the paper, including:

Data Preprocessing: Preparing the ECG signals for training and testing.
Feature Extraction: Extracting features as described by the authors.
Modeling and Classification: Building and training the models to detect sleep apnea events.

## Tools and Libraries


## Web Application

The web application allows users to upload their ECG recordings and obtain predictions in real time.
Visit the website here: **[ECG Based Apnea Detection](https://ecg-based-apnea-detection.streamlit.app/)**
The uploaded data is processed using the same methodology described in the paper, and the results are displayed in an easy-to-understand format.

## Results



## Acknowledgments
We draw inspiration from **["AIOSA: An approach to the automatic identification of obstructive sleep apnea events based on deep learning"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34412849/)**.
